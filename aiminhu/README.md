# Capstone Project: 2018 Podcast Listeners Analysis

## Project Overview
* Podcasters reply on ads for their finance support but they have challenge to target the podcast listeners. The one major reason is podcast platforms can see listeners download the podcast episodes but are unable to get much information about the listeners as almost all podcasts are completely free and listeners don't need to put their information such as credit card or names.

* Audience Insights Inc, a media research consultancy pulling together teams of media, research and data professionals to meet just about any assignment facing clients. 

* This project was a volunteer project for Audience Insights Inc. This project analyze the podcasing listeners in Canada. In Canada, this is just 3rd year to analysis the podcasting data. I used The Canadian Podcast Listener 2018 Survey Data to focuse on below research questions but will not limite to these:

   - To what extent is income affecting people listening podcast?
   - To what extent are gender and age affecting people listening podcast?
   - To what extent are devices affecting listeners of podcasts? 
   - What are the popular 10 podcasts listed from the survery data?
   - How listeners react to the advertising in podcasts?
