### 1: It is continue work from Sprint_1

### 2: Libraries that you will need to load:

library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)
library(DT)
library(knitr)
library(grid)
library(gridExtra)
library(corrplot)

### 3: A R markdown code file is here. You will need podcast18.csv to run this code. Unfortunately, this csv file is not loaded here due to a confidentical policy.

### 4: A PDF file is knit from R markdown file. You will only see results on the PDF file. No codes displayed there.

### 5: In the sprint, I have done below works:
  * Visualization of data: you will see many graphics on PDF file as I have plot some key variables. By plotting graphics, you will see more insights of the data.
  
  * Feature selection based on research questions.
  
  * Used K-Modes(PAM) clustering and Hierarchical clustering for the segmentation analyzing
  
  * Compared to two clusterings by useing cluster.stats() in fpc package.
  
  * Conclusion of comparison: K-Modes(PAM) clustering is better than Hierarchical clustering for this dataset
